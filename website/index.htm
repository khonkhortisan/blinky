<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
Quake Lenses is a sandbox for trying out new fields of view (FOVs) in 3D games.  It allows you to play Quake using a variety of different lenses, and it also allows you to make your own. 
</p>
<p>
This is a late successor to <a href="http://strlen.com/gfxengine/fisheyequake/">Fisheye Quake</a>. It uses the <a href="http://disenchant.net/engine.html">TyrQuake</a> source port for its code base and contains an embedded <a href="http://lua.org">Lua</a> interpreter for dynamically loading lenses.
</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
Quake (or the shareware Quake demo) is required.  Once you have it, you can download Quake Lenses <a href="download.htm">here</a>.  Extract the files into your Quake directory, and run quakelens.exe to play.
</p>

<h3>Available Commands</h3>
This commands can be entered into Quake via the console by pressing the tilde key (~).
<ul>
   <li>lens <name> : change the lens</li>
   <li>hfov <degrees> : specify <acronym title="Field of View">FOV</acronym> in horizontal degrees</li>
   <li>vfov <degrees> : specify <acronym title="Field of View">FOV</acronym> in vertical degrees</li>
   <li>fit : make the lens fit the screen</li>
   <li>hfit : fit horizontally only</li>
   <li>vfit : fit vertically only</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lens Files</h3>
<p>
In the lenses folder of your quake directory, you will see a collection of files.  Each file is a Lua script used by the game to construct a lens.  If you're interested, you can <a href="tutorial.htm">create your own</a> and place it in this folder.
</p>

<h3>Selecting a Lens</h3>
<p>
First, open quakelens.exe, and start a game.  To change your lens, use the <strong>lens</strong> command.  For example, if you wish to use the "panini" lens, type <strong>lens panini</strong>. The game will then load the file called "panini.lua" from the lenses folder.
</p>

<h3>FOV</h3>
<p>
You can zoom in and out by specifying a viewing angle. Type <strong>hfov 180</strong> if you want your screen to horizontally cover 180 degrees.  Similarly, you can type <strong>vfov 90</strong> to cover 90 degrees vertically.
</p>

<h3>Fitting</h3>
<p>
If the image produced by the lens is not infinite in size, you can fit the whole image on the screen by typing <strong>fit</strong>.  Alternately, if you just want the picture to fit the horizontal or vertical bounds of the screen, you can type <strong>hfit</strong> or <strong>vfit</strong>, respectively.
</p>

<h3>Invalid Modes</h3>
<p>
If the lens does not support the current zoom mode, Quake Lenses will give you a blank screen, an error message on the console, and will wait for you to enter a valid zoom mode.  For example, the cube lens does not support FOV; it can only be zoomed to fit the screen.  Another common error happens if the specified FOV is too high for the current lens.
