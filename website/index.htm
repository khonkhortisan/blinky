<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Quake Lenses is a proof-of-concept for trying out new fields of view (FOVs) in 3D games.  It allows you to play Quake using a variety of different lenses, and it even allows you to make your own. 
</p>
<p>
This is a late successor to <a href="http://strlen.com/gfxengine/fisheyequake/">Fisheye Quake</a>. It uses the <a href="http://disenchant.net/engine.html">TyrQuake</a> source port for its code base and embeds the <a href="http://lua.org">Lua</a> interpreter for rapid lens prototyping.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
Quake (or the free Quake demo) is required.  Once you have it, you can download Quake Lenses <a href="download.htm">here</a>.  Extract the files into your Quake directory, and run quakelens.exe to play.
</p>

<h2>Tutorial</h2>

<h3>Available Commands</h3>
<ul>
   <li>lens <name> : change the lens</li>
   <li>hfov <degrees> : specify <acronym title="Field of View">FOV</acronym> in horizontal degrees</li>
   <li>vfov <degrees> : specify <acronym title="Field of View">FOV</acronym> in vertical degrees</li>
   <li>fit : make the lens fit the screen</li>
   <li>hfit : fit horizontally only</li>
   <li>vfit : fit vertically only</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lens Files</h3>
<p>
In the lenses folder of your quake directory, you will see a collection of files.  Each file is a Lua script used by the game to construct a lens.  If you're interested, you can <a href="tutorial.htm">create your own</a> and place it in this folder.
</p>

<h3>Using a Lens in game</h3>
<p>
First, open quakelens.exe, and start a game.  To change your lens, you must first pull down the console by pressing the tilde (~) key.  If you wish to use the "panini" lens, type <strong>lens panini</strong>. The game will then look for a file called "panini.lua" in the lenses folder and it will load it.
</p>

<h2>Adjusting the Lens Zoom</h2>
There are two ways to adjust the zoom of your lens. If one doesn't work, you can try the other.

<h3>FOV</h3>
<p>
You can zoom in/out by specifying an FOV angle. Type <strong>hfov 180</strong> if you want your screen to horizontally cover 180 degrees.  Similarly, you can type <strong>vfov 90</strong> to cover 90 degrees vertically.
</p>

<h3>Fitting</h3>
<p>
If the lens does not produce a picture of infinite size, you can fit it to your screen by typing <strong>fit</strong>.  Alternately, if you just want the picture to fit the horizontal or vertical bounds of the screen, you can type <strong>hfit</strong> or <strong>vfit</strong>, respectively.
