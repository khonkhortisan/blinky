This is a fork of TyrQuake for the purpose of integrating the FishEye mod to work on Linux.  This makes various improvements to the FishEye mod including:
  * seamless cube maps
  * camera rolling
  * variety of fisheye lenses
  * status bar display
  * horizontal, vertical, and diagonal FOV control (changing one will adjust the others)

The following commands are available:
  * hfov (horizontal FOV)
  * vfov (vertical FOV)
  * dfov (diagonal FOV)
  * lens (0|1|2|3 for gnomonic | azimuthal | cylindrical | stereographic lenses)
  * lens_grid (0|1 for drawing the border around the cube map)
  * sbar_show (0|1|2 for the status bar: hidden | health | health+inventory)
