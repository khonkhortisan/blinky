This is a fork of TyrQuake for the purpose of integrating the FishEye mod to work on Linux.  Currently experimenting with different map projections (lenses).

The following commands are available:
  * ffov (vertical degrees of view)
  * fmap (0|1|2|3 for perspective|azimuthal|cylindrical|stereographic)
  * fborder (0|1 for drawing the border around the cube map)
  * sbar_show (0|1 for hiding/showing the status bar)
