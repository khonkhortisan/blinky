Blind is a 1D game.  Just as you must play a 3D game through a 2D screen, we envision a 2D player viewing its world through a 1D screen.

The shape of the screen must be a line.  The path of this line can be changed to curve on a 2D screen in different ways.  This depends on the type of projection used.  A circle would be the best representation for a panoramic type projection.  A straight line would be the best representation for a rectilinear projection.  A parabola might be another.

The objective of this experiment for a 1D game is to determine how well a person can perceive a 2D world through a 1D projection of it.

The player will be walking around, and will see shapes on their 1D screen moving in response to their movement.  This will hopefully create a sense of space when there is nothing else.

Here are some notes from our brainstorming session:
* put them in a dark room at first
* only light objects that you hit
* paint objects that you touch
* find stage of objects in limited amount of steps
* using sound to navigate
* pick one sense that you can keep
   * sound
   * touch
   * sight
* multiple choice guesses for guessing the shape of the room after a fixed amount of allowed steps
* first/third person
* grid-based movement
* shot at/assaulted, must find shapes and manipulate into shield
* dodge bullets after seeing flash
* begin by throwing waves to locate approximate area of shape
* player must navigate to shape to mark it so it appears (anchors) on sphere of vision
* mission to collect and sort shapes without running out of alotted steps.
