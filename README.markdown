# Quake Lenses

A fork of [TyrQuake](http://disenchant.net/engine.html) integrated with [Fisheye Quake](http://strlen.com/gfxengine/fisheyequake/)

## Purpose

To explore different ways to squeeze panoramic views on a small screen using different wide-angle lenses (map projections).

## How is it different from Fisheye Quake?

Fixes:
* seamless cube maps
* camera rolling
* viewsize adjustment with status bar

Improvements:
* variety of fisheye lenses
* horizontal, vertical, and diagonal FOV control (changing one will adjust the others)

## How do I use it?
The following commands are available:
* hfov (horizontal FOV)
* vfov (vertical FOV)
* dfov (diagonal FOV)
* lens (0|1|2|3 for gnomonic | azimuthal | cylindrical | stereographic lenses)
